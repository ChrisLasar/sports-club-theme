# Tasks: Live Preview Deployment System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-preview-deployment/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - focusing on implementation and manual verification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can start after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Can start after Phase 2 (parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 completion (needs preview metadata structure)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (optimizes existing workflows)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US2 completion (needs preview directory structure)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - Only needs Foundational phase ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Independent - Only needs Foundational phase ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (reads preview metadata from deployments)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 and US2 (optimizes their workflows)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (cleans up preview directories)

### Within Each User Story

- User Story 1: Sequential implementation (workflow setup ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí test)
- User Story 2: Sequential implementation (workflow setup ‚Üí build with error handling ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí test both success and failure)
- User Story 3: Sequential implementation (HTML template ‚Üí JSON aggregation ‚Üí JavaScript rendering ‚Üí integration)
- User Story 4: Can parallelize cache configuration tasks across workflows
- User Story 5: Sequential implementation (workflow setup ‚Üí cleanup logic ‚Üí test)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**: Tasks T001-T005 are mostly sequential (each builds on previous)

**Foundational Phase**: 
- T007 (Hugo cache) and T008 (npm cache) can run in parallel [P]
- Scripts T010, T011, T012 can be developed in parallel [P]

**User Story 1 & 2**: Can be developed in parallel by different team members after Phase 2 completes
- T013-T030 (US1 main branch workflow)
- T031-T051 (US2 feature branch workflow)

**User Story 3**: Sequential after US2

**User Story 4**: Cache optimizations can be applied to both workflows in parallel
- T065-T069 workflow modifications can happen simultaneously

**User Story 5**: Sequential after US2

**Polish Phase**: Most documentation tasks (T086-T100) can run in parallel [P]

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

If you have 2 developers, you can parallelize Phase 2:

**Developer A**:
```bash
# Hugo and npm caching
git checkout -b foundational/caching
# T007: Configure Hugo cache
# T008: Configure npm cache
```

**Developer B**:
```bash
# Helper scripts
git checkout -b foundational/scripts
# T010: Branch sanitization script
# T011: Metadata generation script
# T012: Preview index generation script
```

Then merge both branches to complete Phase 2.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 & 2

Once Foundational phase is complete, work on both MVP user stories simultaneously:

**Developer A (Main Branch Deployment)**:
```bash
git checkout -b us1-main-branch-deploy
# Complete all T013-T030 tasks
# Test by pushing to main
```

**Developer B (Feature Branch Deployment)**:
```bash
git checkout -b us2-feature-branch-deploy
# Complete all T031-T051 tasks
# Test by creating feature branch
```

Both can work independently and deliver simultaneously.

---

## MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Stories 1 and 2 (both P1)

This delivers:
- ‚úÖ Main branch deploys to root GitHub Pages URL
- ‚úÖ Feature branches deploy to /preview/{branch-name}/ URLs
- ‚úÖ Error handling for failed builds
- ‚úÖ Automatic updates on new commits
- ‚úÖ Concurrency control and cancellation

With just US1 and US2, developers can:
- View latest main branch state online
- Create feature branch previews for evaluation
- Share preview URLs with stakeholders
- Iterate rapidly with automatic updates

**Post-MVP Enhancements**:
- US3 (P2): Preview index for easy navigation (nice to have)
- US4 (P2): Build caching for faster deployments (performance optimization)
- US5 (P3): Automatic cleanup (maintenance feature)

---

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Complete Setup and Foundational phases (T001-T012)
   - Establish infrastructure
   - Create helper scripts
   - No preview deployments yet, but foundation is ready

2. **Week 2**: Implement MVP (US1 + US2) (T013-T051)
   - Can parallelize with 2 developers
   - Both workflows complete and tested
   - System is functional for core use cases

3. **Week 3**: Add preview index (US3) (T052-T064)
   - Improves user experience
   - Easier to navigate between previews

4. **Week 4**: Optimize performance (US4) and add cleanup (US5) (T065-T085)
   - Build times improve with caching
   - Automatic cleanup prevents bloat

5. **Week 5**: Polish and documentation (T086-T100)
   - Complete documentation
   - Final validation and testing

**Total Estimated Effort**: 100 tasks across 5 weeks (20 tasks/week average)

**Critical Path**: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1/US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4/US5 ‚Üí Polish

**Risk Mitigation**: 
- US1 and US2 are independent and can proceed in parallel
- If time is limited, ship MVP (US1+US2) first
- US3-US5 can be added incrementally in later releases
