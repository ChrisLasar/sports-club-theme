# Feature Specification: Live Preview Deployment System

**Feature Branch**: `002-preview-deployment`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to be able to see and evaluate the results of changes to the template as quickly as possible on the internet using the example. This applies to changes in the main branch as well as in all other branches."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Main Branch Preview (Priority: P1)

As a developer or stakeholder, I want to view the live preview of the main branch on the internet so that I can see the current production state of the theme with example content.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation - everyone needs to see what'\''s currently in main/production. Without this, there'\''s no baseline for comparison.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pushing a commit to main branch and verifying the preview URL updates within expected time, delivering a working demo site.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have pushed changes to the main branch, **When** the deployment completes, **Then** I can access a live preview URL showing the latest main branch state
2. **Given** the main branch preview is live, **When** I visit the preview URL, **Then** all example content renders correctly with the current theme
3. **Given** the main branch has been deployed, **When** I check the deployment status, **Then** I can see the deployment timestamp and commit hash

### User Story 2 - View Feature Branch Preview (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on a feature branch, I want to view a live preview of my branch changes on the internet so that I can evaluate and share my work-in-progress without merging.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement - being able to preview ANY branch is critical for fast iteration and feedback. This enables parallel development and stakeholder review.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new feature branch, pushing changes, and verifying a unique preview URL is created and updated, delivering an isolated demo of that branch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have created and pushed a feature branch, **When** the deployment completes, **Then** I can access a unique preview URL specific to that branch
2. **Given** I make additional commits to my feature branch, **When** the deployment completes, **Then** the preview URL automatically updates to show my latest changes
3. **Given** multiple feature branches exist, **When** I access each branch'\''s preview URL, **Then** each shows its respective branch'\''s version of the theme
4. **Given** a feature branch preview exists, **When** I share the preview URL with stakeholders, **Then** they can access and evaluate the changes without any authentication

---

### User Story 3 - Quick Access to Preview URLs (Priority: P2)

As a developer or stakeholder, I want easy access to all active preview URLs so that I can quickly navigate between different branch previews for comparison.

**Why this priority**: While essential for workflow efficiency, this is a convenience feature that improves the experience of using the core preview functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing a dashboard or documentation page that lists all active preview URLs and verifying links work, delivering quick navigation between previews.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple branch previews exist, **When** I access the preview index/dashboard, **Then** I see a list of all active preview URLs with branch names
2. **Given** I am viewing a preview URL list, **When** I click on a branch name, **Then** I am taken to that branch'\''s live preview
3. **Given** a branch has been deleted, **When** I check the preview list, **Then** that branch'\''s preview URL is no longer listed

---

### User Story 4 - Fast Deployment Times (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want preview deployments to complete quickly so that I can iterate rapidly on changes without long waiting periods.

**Why this priority**: Speed is important for productivity but the preview must exist first (P1). This improves the developer experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring deployment times from push to live preview and verifying they meet performance targets, delivering rapid feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I push a small change to a branch, **When** the deployment process runs, **Then** the preview is live within 3 minutes
2. **Given** I push changes to an existing preview, **When** the deployment process runs, **Then** the incremental update completes faster than initial deployment
3. **Given** the deployment is in progress, **When** I check the status, **Then** I can see progress indicators or estimated completion time

---

### User Story 5 - Preview Cleanup (Priority: P3)

As a project maintainer, I want old preview deployments to be automatically cleaned up so that resources aren'\''t wasted on abandoned branches.

**Why this priority**: This is a maintenance/optimization feature that prevents resource waste but isn'\''t critical for the core preview functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a branch and verifying its preview is removed, or waiting for an inactive preview to expire, delivering automated cleanup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature branch has been deleted from the repository, **When** the cleanup process runs, **Then** the associated preview deployment is removed
2. **Given** a preview has been inactive for the retention period, **When** the cleanup process runs, **Then** the preview deployment is automatically removed
3. **Given** a preview is scheduled for cleanup, **When** I access its URL after cleanup, **Then** I see a helpful message indicating the preview is no longer available

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a branch has build errors or fails to compile?
- How do we handle branches with identical names but different remote repositories (forks)?
- What if deployment service has rate limits or quotas?
- How do we handle very large sites (1000+ pages) that take long to build?
- What happens if two developers push to the same branch simultaneously?
- How do we ensure preview URLs remain stable across deployments (don'\''t change on every push)?
- What happens when the Hugo version changes between branches?
- How do we handle branches with custom dependencies or build configurations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST automatically deploy the main branch to a publicly accessible preview URL whenever changes are pushed
- **FR-002**: The system MUST automatically deploy each feature branch to a unique, publicly accessible preview URL whenever changes are pushed to that branch
- **FR-003**: Each branch preview MUST be accessible via a stable, predictable URL pattern (e.g., `https://preview.example.com/branch-name` or `https://branch-name.preview.example.com`)
- **FR-004**: Preview deployments MUST build and deploy the complete Hugo site including all example content, theme files, and assets
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a way to view the list of all currently active preview URLs (e.g., dashboard, README, or index page)
- **FR-006**: Deployment status and progress MUST be visible to developers (e.g., via commit status checks, deployment logs, or dashboard)
- **FR-007**: Preview deployments MUST be publicly accessible without requiring authentication or login
- **FR-008**: Failed deployments MUST display helpful error messages and not break existing previews
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD complete deployments within 5 minutes of a push for most changes
- **FR-010**: Preview deployments MUST be automatically removed immediately when their associated branch is deleted (no retention period for inactive branches)
- **FR-011**: The system MUST support concurrent deployments for multiple branches
- **FR-012**: Each preview MUST display which branch and commit it was built from (e.g., in footer or header)

### Key Entities

- **Branch Preview**: A deployed instance of the Hugo site for a specific Git branch, accessible via unique URL, containing metadata (branch name, commit hash, deployment timestamp, build status)
- **Deployment**: A build and publish process triggered by a Git push, containing metadata (status, start/end time, logs, errors)
- **Preview Index**: A list or dashboard showing all active branch previews with their URLs and metadata

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
