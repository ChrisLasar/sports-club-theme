# Tasks: Sports Club Static Site Template

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-sports-club-ssg/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit tests requested in feature specification. Implementation tasks only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Hugo project structure with:

- `archetypes/` - Content type templates
- `assets/` - CSS, JS, and other resources requiring processing
- `content/` - Markdown content files
- `data/` - YAML data files
- `layouts/` - HTML templates
- `static/` - Static files (admin, images)
- `config/_default/` - Hugo configuration

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

- [X] T001 Initialize Hugo Extended 0.152+ site structure with required directories (archetypes/, assets/, content/, data/, layouts/, static/, config/_default/)
- [X] T002 Create config/_default/hugo.toml with base configuration, taxonomies (team, tag, category), and performance settings

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can proceed independently
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1/US2 but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Teams and Members - Foundation for club presence
  - Required for: Homepage team listings
  - Blocks: Team-based filtering in US2, team tagging in US3
  
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Events and Results - Built on team taxonomy from US1
  - Required for: Event/result listings on team pages
  - Can start: After US1 team content structure exists
  - Independent: Has own layouts and can be tested separately
  
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: News Posts and CMS - Integrates with teams from US1
  - Required for: Complete editorial workflow
  - Can start: After US1 team content exists for tagging
  - Independent: CMS configuration works for all content types

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Teams & Members)**:

1. Archetypes first (T021-T022) - can run in parallel
2. Example content next (T023-T026) - can run in parallel
3. Layouts (T027-T030) - single before list, members after teams
4. Partials (T031-T033) - can run in parallel
5. Styling and enhancements (T034-T038) - sequential on layouts

**User Story 2 (Events & Results)**:

1. Archetypes first (T039-T040) - can run in parallel
2. Example content next (T041-T045) - can run in parallel
3. Layouts (T046-T049) - single before list
4. Partials (T050-T051) - can run in parallel
5. Filters, styling, integration (T052-T058)

**User Story 3 (Posts & CMS)**:

1. Archetype and examples (T059-T062) - can run in parallel
2. Layouts and partials (T063-T065) - can run in parallel
3. Styling and integration (T066-T070)
4. CMS setup (T071-T073) - sequential
5. Testing and documentation (T074-T075)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T006-T008 can run in parallel
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T012-T015, T018-T020 can run in parallel after base templates
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T021-T026, T031-T033 can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T039-T045, T050-T051 can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T059-T062, T063-T065 can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: T076-T080, T082-T086, T088-T090, T092-T094, T096-T099 can run in parallel

Task T033: "Create layouts/partials/training-schedule.html"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. **Complete Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T008)
   - Hugo project initialization
   - Tailwind/daisyUI setup
   - Basic project structure

2. **Complete Phase 2: Foundational** (T009-T020) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - Base layouts and partials
   - Social metadata
   - Image processing
   - Accessibility foundation

3. **Complete Phase 3: User Story 1** (T021-T038)
   - Teams and Members content types
   - Training schedule display
   - Contact information
   
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Test team page accessibility
   - Verify training times are visible
   - Check contact information display
   - Test on mobile and desktop
   - Validate 30-second findability goal

5. **Deploy/Demo MVP**: Working sports club site with team information

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1 + 2) ‚Üí Hugo site with base templates
2. **+ User Story 1** (Phase 3) ‚Üí Teams and training schedules visible ‚Üí **Deploy MVP**
3. **+ User Story 2** (Phase 4) ‚Üí Events and results tracking ‚Üí **Deploy v1.1**
4. **+ User Story 3** (Phase 5) ‚Üí Full CMS editorial workflow ‚Üí **Deploy v1.2**
5. **+ Polish** (Phase 6) ‚Üí Optimized, accessible, production-ready ‚Üí **Deploy v2.0**

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
   
2. **Once Foundational is done, split work:**
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Teams/Members) - T021-T038
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Events/Results) - T039-T058 (starts after T021-T026 for team taxonomy)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Posts/CMS) - T059-T075 (starts after T021-T026 for team tagging)

3. **Stories integrate and test independently**

4. **Team completes Polish together** (Phase 6)

## Notes

- All tasks follow checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- [P] indicates parallelizable tasks (different files, no blocking dependencies)
- [Story] labels (US1, US2, US3) map to user stories from spec.md
- Each user story phase is independently completable and testable
- No tests included as none were explicitly requested in specification
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- Stop at checkpoints to validate story completion before proceeding
- Total: 100 tasks across 6 phases supporting 3 user stories
