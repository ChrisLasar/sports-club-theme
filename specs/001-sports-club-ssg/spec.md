# Feature Specification: Sports Club Static Site Template

**Feature Branch**: `001-sports-club-ssg`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Sports clubs are social networks in the real world. In order to increase their appeal, especially among younger people, they need a counterpart in the virtual world. This virtual presence differs in content from that of private individuals. In addition to a classic blog, a club also has training times, members with and without specific tasks in the club, events, competition results, training times, etc. We are creating a template for a static site generator that allows clubs to establish their virtual presence cost-effectively and with little technical know-how. The content can be maintained by various club members without any technical know-how."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Find training times and contact (Priority: P1)

A prospective member or parent visits the website to find training times, venue, and a contact person for a specific age group/team.

**Why this priority**: This is the most common real-world task that converts interest into participation and membership.

**Independent Test**: Visiting users can locate a team page and see current training schedule, venue address/map, and a contact within 30 seconds from the homepage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a visitor on the homepage, When they select a sport/team/age group, Then they see training days, start/end times, venue/location, season dates, and a clear contact (name and email/phone) on one page.
2. Given a team is out-of-season, When the visitor opens the team page, Then they see a clear "off-season" message with next season start or alternative contact.

### User Story 2 - Check fixtures, events, and results (Priority: P2)

A member or fan wants to see upcoming fixtures/events and past results for their team, with dates and locations.

**Why this priority**: Keeps current members engaged and reduces coordination overhead across messaging groups.

**Independent Test**: Users can view an events listing and a results archive filtered by team, with each item linking to a detail page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a visitor on the Events page, When they filter by team, Then the list updates to show that team’s upcoming fixtures with date, opponent/event title, and location.
2. Given a visitor on the Results page, When they view a past event, Then they see score/placement, key highlights/notes, and any media gallery.

---

### User Story 3 - Publish a news post without technical skills (Priority: P3)

A club editor (non-technical) publishes a news update with images and assigns it to one or more teams.

**Why this priority**: Reduces reliance on a single technical admin; enables consistent, up-to-date content.

**Independent Test**: An editor can draft, preview, and publish a post with title, summary, body, images, tags, and team associations without using a command line or writing code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given an editor, When they create a draft post with title, summary, body, image, and team tags, Then they can preview and publish it via a simple workflow.
2. Given a published post, When a visitor opens a team page, Then relevant posts appear automatically in that team’s news feed.

### Edge Cases

- Team has no active season: clearly display "off-season" messaging and contact alternatives.
- Training cancellations/changes: show a prominent notice banner on the team page with last-updated timestamp.
- Members with multiple roles or teams: ensure profile pages can list multiple roles/teams without duplication.
- Overlapping events/fixtures: list with distinct times and avoid visual conflicts in calendars.
- Image-heavy posts: gracefully degrade on slow networks with sensible fallbacks and captions.
- Very long team names or event titles: wrap text without breaking layout; ensure social previews truncate elegantly.
- Accessibility: all interactive elements are keyboard operable and labeled; color contrast meets AA.
- Progressive enhancement: all content (navigation, schedules, posts) remains usable with JavaScript disabled.
- Responsive layout: readable and navigable on ≤320px mobile and ≥1440px desktop screens.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 Content Types**: The template must support core club content types: Home, News/Blog, Teams (with pages per team/age group), Training Schedule, Events/Fixtures, Results, Members/Staff directory (roles/responsibilities), About/Contact, and Media/Galleries.
  - Acceptance: Each content type has a dedicated listing and detail layout where applicable; example content is included for each type.

- **FR-002 Team Pages**: Each team page must present training days/times, venue/location, season dates, staff contacts, and auto-related news/events.
  - Acceptance: For at least one sample team, all fields render correctly; when a field is missing (e.g., venue), a helpful default message appears.

- **FR-003 Events & Results**: Provide list and detail pages for events/fixtures and results, with filtering by team and date.
  - Acceptance: Users can filter to a team and see both upcoming events and a results archive; a result detail shows opponent/event, date, score/placement, and notes.

- **FR-004 Navigation & Findability**: Navigation must be mobile-first and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), with clear routes to Teams, Training, Events, Results, and News.
  - Acceptance: From the homepage, users reach a specific team page in ≤2 taps/clicks on mobile; keyboard-only navigation works end-to-end.

- **FR-005 Media & Social Metadata**: Pages must include human-friendly titles, summaries, and images for social sharing (Open Graph/Twitter equivalents) with sensible defaults and per-page overrides.
  - Acceptance: Example pages display correct title/description/image in link previews; defaults apply when a page lacks a custom image.

- **FR-006 Performance & Progressive Enhancement**: Any optional interactivity must be additive; core content functions without JavaScript. Keep overall client-side script budget minimal.
  - Acceptance: Example pages function with scripts disabled; total client-side script payload on example pages stays within the performance budget in Success Criteria.

- **FR-007 Non-Technical Editing Workflow**: The template must enable editors without technical skills to create and update content (posts, schedules, events) through a simple, guided process.
  - Acceptance: A documented editing flow in the spec’s quickstart demonstrates how an editor can publish a post and update a team’s training time without using a terminal or code.
  - Editorial workflow: External file-based process with a simple web UI for repository-based content editing; no command-line required. Preview/publish steps are documented in the quickstart.

- **FR-008 Data Ownership & Privacy**: Avoid collecting sensitive personal data; member profiles show only consented public info (name, role, optional portrait).
  - Acceptance: Example member pages exclude contact details unless explicitly marked public; a privacy note is present in docs.

- **FR-009 Internationalization Scope**: Define whether the initial template targets a single language or includes multi-language content structure.
  - Acceptance: If single-language, all labels/content are in one language with a documented path to add more later; if multi-language, the structure supports translated copies.
  - Language strategy: Single-language for initial release with a documented migration path to a multilingual structure in planning.

- **FR-010 Results Data Source**: Clarify whether competition results are entered manually by editors or imported from external associations/feeds.
  - Acceptance: The chosen approach is documented with example content; if manual, editors can add result entries easily; if import, outline the inputs.
  - Results sourcing: Manual entry by editors at launch; no external results integrations in the initial release.

- **FR-011 Examples & Documentation**: Provide minimal example content for each content type and keep documentation up to date in this feature’s quickstart.
  - Acceptance: The `quickstart.md` explains content structures and the editing workflow; examples render successfully.
