# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. If a commands doc is missing, describe the execution workflow directly here.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Hugo 152.2  
**Primary Dependencies**: daisyUI, Tailwind, alpine, sveltia CMS (see Documentation of Decap CMS),
**Storage**: SSG: files only; page bundles supported;  
**Testing**: HTML/Accessibility lint, Lighthouse; unit tests if applicable
**Target Platform**: Static Web Hosting, CDN
**Project Type**: web  
**Constraints**: fully static output; no login; LCP ≤ 2.5s (3G), CLS ≤ 0.1; JS ≤ 50KB gzip; mobile-first; privacy by default  


## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

- Gate A: No login/auth dependencies introduced.
- Gate B: Build is fully static; no runtime calls required for core pages.
- Gate C: Accessibility (AA) for default components.
- Gate D: Performance budgets met on example pages.
- Gate E: Human-readable content; schemas documented.
- Gate F: Mobile responsiveness validated.
- Gate G: Social metadata present (OG, Twitter, canonical).
- Gate H: Example content exists and docs updated in parallel.

### Source Code (repository root)

```text
archetypes/
assets/
content/
data/
i18n/
layouts/
static/
config/
config/_default/hugo.toml (or .yaml/.json)
```

Notes:

- Prefer a single config file where possible.
- Support colocated page bundles/resources under `content/`.
- Keep JS optional; if needed, prefer Alpine.js for enhancements.

**Structure Decision**:
Default Hugo directory structure:
- archetypes: The archetypes directory contains templates for new content.
- assets: The assets directory contains global resources typically passed through an asset pipeline. This includes resources such as images, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
- config: The config directory contains your site configuration, possibly split into multiple subdirectories and files. For projects with minimal configuration or projects that do not need to behave differently in different environments, a single configuration file named hugo.toml in the root of the project is sufficient.
- content: The content directory contains the markup files (typically Markdown) and page resources that comprise the content of your site.
- data: The data directory contains data files (JSON, TOML, YAML, or XML) that augment content, configuration, localization, and navigation.
- i18n: The i18n directory contains translation tables for multilingual sites.
- layouts: The layouts directory contains templates to transform content, data, and resources into a complete website.
- public: The public directory contains the published website, generated when you run the hugo or hugo server commands. Hugo recreates this directory and its content as needed.
- resources: The resources directory contains cached output from Hugo’s asset pipelines, generated when you run the hugo or hugo server commands. By default this cache directory includes CSS and images. Hugo recreates this directory and its content as needed.
- static: The static directory contains files that will be copied to the public directory when you build your site. For example: favicon.ico, robots.txt, and files that verify site ownership. Before the introduction of page bundles and asset pipelines, the static directory was also used for images, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
