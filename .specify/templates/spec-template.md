# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when a page has missing or minimal front matter?
- How do we handle very long titles/descriptions for social previews?
- What if no social image is provided — do we generate a fallback safely?
- How does the layout behave on very small screens (≤320px) and large screens (≥1440px)?
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled (progressive enhancement)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Template MUST render [content type] pages from Markdown with front matter.
- **FR-002**: Build MUST generate required social metadata (Open Graph, Twitter, canonical) with sensible defaults and per-page overrides.
- **FR-003**: Navigation MUST be mobile-first and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), functioning without JavaScript.
- **FR-004**: Images MAY be processed at build time (resize, WebP/AVIF) and support colocated page bundles.
- **FR-005**: Any JavaScript MUST be progressive enhancement; if needed, prefer Alpine.js components kept under 50KB gzip total.
- **FR-006**: A minimal example (content + usage) MUST be added for this feature under `example/` or `content/`.
- **FR-007**: Documentation for this feature MUST be updated in parallel in `docs/` or the feature spec’s `quickstart.md`.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-008**: Social image generation rules [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: template, dimensions, fallback strategy].
- **FR-009**: Supported front matter keys [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: list and defaults].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Homepage and article example meet performance budgets (LCP ≤ 2.5s on 3G, CLS ≤ 0.1, total JS ≤ 50KB gzip).
- **SC-002**: Default components pass accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA) via lint/audit on example pages.
- **SC-003**: Social metadata is present and correct on example pages (OG title/description/image, Twitter card, canonical URL).
- **SC-004**: Feature can be demonstrated with a minimal example content file; docs updated alongside implementation.

## Constitution Alignment Checklist

> Verify the feature complies with the Constitution quality gates.

- No login/auth or server/database introduced by this feature.
- Output remains fully static; enhancements degrade gracefully without JS.
- Content stays human-readable; front matter keys documented.
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility validated on example pages.
- Social metadata defaults and overrides function as specified.
