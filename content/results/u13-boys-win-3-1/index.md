## Match Report

Our U13 Boys delivered an impressive home performance, defeating City Youth 3-1 in a commanding display that showcased the team's growing confidence and tactical understanding.

### First Half

The match started brightly with our team controlling possession from the outset. Alex opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a well-taken finish after excellent build-up play down the right wing. The team continued to press and were rewarded when Jamie doubled the lead just before half-time with a powerful header from a corner kick.

### Second Half

City Youth came out with more urgency in the second half and pulled a goal back through a well-executed counter-attack in the 55th minute. However, our boys responded magnificently, with Taylor restoring the two-goal cushion just five minutes later with a composed finish after a clever through ball from Alex.
