## Tournament Report

Our U15 Girls Tennis team delivered an exceptional performance at the Regional Tournament, finishing as runners-up after three days of competitive play against the region's best teams.

### Group Stage (Day 1)

The team started strong, winning all three group matches to finish top of Group A:

- **vs Coastal Academy**: 5-1 (Won)
- **vs Riverside Tennis Club**: 4-2 (Won)
- **vs Mountain View**: 6-0 (Won)

Outstanding performances from Emma, Sophie, and Lily secured our place in the knockout stages with maximum points.

### Quarter-Final (Day 2 - Morning)

**vs St. Mary's Tennis Academy**: 4-2 (Won)

A tense match that saw us recover from being 2-1 down. Brilliant doubles play from Emma and Sophie turned the tide, and strong singles performances from Lily and Grace sealed the victory.

### Semi-Final (Day 2 - Afternoon)

**vs Defending Champions Oakwood**: 4-3 (Won)

The match of the tournament! In an incredible display of skill and determination, our girls defeated last year's champions in a nail-biting encounter that went down to the final match. Emma's composure in the deciding singles match was exceptional.

### Final (Day 3)

**vs County Elite Tennis**: 2-5 (Lost)

Despite a valiant effort, we came up against a very strong County Elite team in the final. The girls fought hard in every match, but County Elite's experience at this level proved decisive. Nevertheless, finishing as runners-up is an outstanding achievement.

## Coach's Comments

"I couldn't be prouder of these girls. To finish second in such a competitive field is a fantastic achievement. The way they supported each other throughout the three days, showing true team spirit even in individual matches, was exemplary. Emma's award for Best Server is well-deserved, but every member of this team played their part in our success.

The experience gained from playing at this level will be invaluable as we prepare for the National qualifiers next spring. Well done, team!"

â€” Sarah Jones, Head Coach
