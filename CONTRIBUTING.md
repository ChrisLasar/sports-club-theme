## For Content Editors

### Content Standards

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Use clear, concise language appropriate for all ages
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain when used
- Write in an inclusive, welcoming tone
- Proofread before publishing

**Image Requirements:**
- **Format**: JPG or PNG preferred
- **Size**: Maximum 2MB per image (will be optimized automatically)
- **Dimensions**: Minimum 1200x630px for social images
- **Alt Text**: ALWAYS provide descriptive alt text for accessibility
- **Consent**: Obtain written consent before publishing photos of youth members

**Member Privacy:**
- Never publish personal email addresses or phone numbers for youth members
- Use generic team emails (e.g., `u13@yourclub.org`)
- Enable "Portrait Consent" ONLY with explicit written permission
- Default privacy setting is portraits hiddenâ€”this is intentional
- Obtain parent/guardian consent for all youth member data

**Content Types:**

1. **Teams**: Update training schedules at start of each season
